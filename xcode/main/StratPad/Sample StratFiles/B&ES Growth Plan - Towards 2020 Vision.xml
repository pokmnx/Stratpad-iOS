	<keyProblems>Emerging from the Heating and Ventilating Contractors Association (HVCA), the leading trade association for the heating and ventilating contracting industry established in 1904, the Building &amp; Engineering Services Association (B&amp;ES) is the new name for the former HVCA.

B&amp;ES provides business support to circa 1400 firms who initially were engaged in heating and ventilating design, installation and maintenance, but more recently through recognition of a changing agenda, B&amp;ES membership has included businesses which work across the mechanical, electrical and plumbing professions. These multi services businesses together with facilities management firms present the greatest opportunity for growth of B&amp;ES.

The chief construction adviser has called upon the construction sector to significantly improve its productivity across the whole supply chain, including building engineering services. These improvement require a modern approach to employment working practices. The increased pressure on energy and thermal efficiency in buildings presents the sector with the opportunity to expand its offerings in terms of a holistic approach to building design and retrofit embracing new technologies which are emerging to meet the efficiency demands of buildings. Coupled with this is the emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a productivity improvement tool which will require new ways of thinking about building design and specification in which the sector will need to be proficient within a relatively short time frame.
 
Failure to adapt quickly to a changing marketplace is itself an aspect of competition which could see another body emerging or an existing organisation occupying that space. </keyProblems>
	<addressProblems>B&amp;ES offers support for its members, their clients and the industry at large through the following products and services:

Political lobbying to shape government policy on health and safety, training, procurement, regulations and standards on behalf of the membership.

Publication and embedding into client specifications, technical standards compiled by industry experts to establish a level playing field which supports members and their clients.

Professional advice on the legal and contractual obligations of members and their clients.

A rigorous inspection and assessment regime which all members are required to meet and continue to comply with during membership of B&amp;ES

Promotion and promulgation of the excellence provided by the members of the Association.

Specification of standards together with confirmation of the skills and competence of employees to meet the current and future needs of employers in the sector.

A vehicle for businesses operating within the sector to come together to share best practice and define the future direction of the sector.

The ongoing maintenance of nationally negotiated wage agreements that set the standard for employment terms and conditions within the sector.

The provision of a membership driven welfare and benefits provider service.

Training, assessment and registration schemes for individuals and businesses which include; GasSafe, F Gas, Refcom and Refcom Elite, Competence Persons Scheme, SkillCard and apprenticeship programmes.</addressProblems>
	<customersDescription>B&amp;ES only recruits reputable building engineering services businesses who are able to meet the exacting standards set by clients and which are verified through the Inspection and Assessment (I&amp;A) programme established by B&amp;ES and verified through a third party organisation. Retention of membership of B&amp;ES requires the ability of the member business to satisfy and maintain membership through regular re-inspection against the I&amp;A standard. 

These businesses will typically be medium to large enterprises with a combined Mechanical and Electrical turnover of £FIGURE plus. They will be engaged in at least one discipline which includes;  design, specification, manufacture, installation, maintenance and decommissioning of mechanical and electrical building engineering services systems. They will contract in the construction or refurbishment of large domestic, industrial or commercial projects and may have divisions that span more than one of these areas.</customersDescription>
	<competitorsDescription>Whilst there are no direct competitor trade associations, there are a number of bodies competing for subscriptions from those within membership of B&amp;ES. The repositioning of HVCA to B&amp;ES was amongst other drivers. Recognition that another competitor to membership of B&amp;ES was a failure to respond to revised employment practices, together with a increased need for the immediacy of information, has also driven the need for change. 

Other trade associations within the building engineering services sector will be watching closely for any predatory action or failure to provide services in the marketplace as an opportunity to compete to occupy the current B&amp;ES space.</competitorsDescription>
	<businessModelDescription>Revenue is generated from:

- member subscription based on M&amp;E turnover
- sale of publications
- sale of welfare benefits
- sale of training programmes
- schemes accreditation.
</businessModelDescription>
	<expansionOptionsDescription>Expansion opportunities exist in the following areas:

- Membership recruitment from current non member businesses within the footprint of B&amp;ES.
- Expansion of membership into areas currently not considered relevant or under represented.
- Increased engagement in non-core services including welfare benefits and training by members.
- Service provision to non member businesses at a commercial market rate.
- Sale of publications and technical manuals relevant to occupations within the supply chain of members.

</expansionOptionsDescription>
	<ultimateAspiration>We visualise B&amp;ES as a model  21st Century trade association that has significant political influence  in the formulation of policy relating to building engineering services, is the respected business support service for members and responds swiftly to change. </ultimateAspiration>
	<mediumTermStrategicGoal>By 2020 we wish to provide 2000 member companies with a single point contact process for all aspects of the trade association's activities.

We have identified additional market areas and begun to make inroads into membership recruitment. 

Within three years our subsidiary businesses (specifically Welplan, BEST, Piper) will be selling services into an developing market, emerging from recession.

Within twenty four  months we will have embedded the name of B&amp;ES as the successor trade association to HVCA achieving a 65% unprompted recognition within the sector and 50% with other stakeholder organisations, growing that response by 10% per annum to 2020.
