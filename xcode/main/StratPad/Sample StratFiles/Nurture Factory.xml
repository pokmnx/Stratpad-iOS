	<keyProblems>Our customers need to be selling more via online channels. They have websites that are not performing as they would like. Many of our customers are spending far too much money marketing on the web and not receiving the results that they would wish

Old style push marketing techniques are increasingly irrelevant and less successful than they used to be. Inbound marketing implies being there, in the right place, at the right time when the customer is ready to buy our products or services, and through establishing relationships, be a trusted source from which purchase.

Our clients have historically been b2b companies. However, inbound marketing is equally appropriate for b2c as it is for b2b. Large organisations over and above 600 people will likely be using one of the expensive existing integrated marketing packages whereas small businesses under 50 heads are unlikely to have the resources to implement an inbound marketing project successfully. Our target market is therefore medium-sized companies, between 50 and 600 employees.</keyProblems>
	<addressProblems>Our products and associated service offerings will enable companies to cost-effectively design and implement an inbound marketing strategy, to reduce online marketing costs, whilst increasing the effectiveness of their marketing efforts, and at the same time strengthening their online brand.</addressProblems>
	<customersDescription>Our target customer is a medium sized business, with between 50-600 employees. They will have a significant online marketing budget. They will be looking to reduce marketing costs, such as Google Adwords paid search, and to improve customer acquisition and retention.

They will be in a market where their online reputation and strength of brand are both important to them. They will have a willingness to strengthen their brand and provide a much improved customer experience, leading to a stronger position in their market vis a vis their competitors.

Our offering will help them to better manage their online presence, improve customer acquisition and retention, increase sales from new customers and return visitors, and strengthen their brand's perception and effectiveness.</customersDescription>
	<competitorsDescription>Our main competitors are:
Hubspot
Tomorrow People
Brightfire
Other Hubspot partners
Marketo

Strengths:
Integrated tool sets
Integrated email marketing and CRM
Lead nurturing program
Plenty of marketing materials
Simple data analysis
They use their own product - walk the walk
Free trial

Weaknesses
Users must create their own unique content
Simplistic analytics mean no ability to dig deep
Less informative than Google Analytics, which is free
Insufficient depth of information for experienced Internet marketers to improve on
The CMS does not have flexibility to produce attractive or complex websites
Any help starts at around £60/hour
Hubspot venture fund means aggressive sales model
Initial cost is too much for many companies - from around £7,000 plus £1,500 initial training, all upfront
Hubspot recommend also hiring a consultant for around £3-4,000 a month (Peter Caputa, Hubspot)
None of the tools are innovative and many similar available for free. Value is in dashboard.
For a serious CRM, costly integration with Salesforce is necessary
Your competitors could switch to Hubspot and negate any competitive advantage
</competitorsDescription>
	<businessModelDescription>Initial consultancy and implementation
Monthly retainer fees for product access and management
Monthly fees for services - we perform what our competitors want clients to do in-house.
Ongoing consultancy and advice
</businessModelDescription>
	<expansionOptionsDescription>There would be further opportunities from associated consultancy activity, such as integration with Joomla!, an open source CMS, such as Search High use to manage our website content</expansionOptionsDescription>
	<ultimateAspiration>Search High aim to provide the best performing, easiest to use, integrated inbound online marketing solution, at a highly competitive price, through the use and integration of a combination of best-of-breed and open source products.</ultimateAspiration>
	<mediumTermStrategicGoal>Our aim is to provide an integrated inbound marketing solution that medium size businesses can use at a lower cost than competitors such as Hubspot, but with fully integrated functionality, whilst improving on some of the areas of weakness that Hubspot currently has.
