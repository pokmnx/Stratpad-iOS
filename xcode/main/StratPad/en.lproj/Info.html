<div class="heading">About StratPad</div>
    
<p>StratPad was created to help businesses perform better. Period.</p>

<p>It simplifies business plans (and business planning). It helps you think differently, plan differently and manage differently.</p>

<p>StratPad was designed by Alex Glassey, a former big-5 consultant turned serial entrepreneur, professor and business advisor. "Entrepreneurs and small business owners should have access to world-class business tools that are tailored to their unique needs. That's why I created StratPad."</p>

<p>Thousands of businesses (and their consultants) have made StratPad the highest-rated business planning and strategy app in the world.</p>

<p>We hope you find it useful, too.</p>
