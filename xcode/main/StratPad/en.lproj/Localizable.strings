  NB.   \n is a line feed (ie a new line)
        %@ is a placeholder - it will be replaced with some dynamic text, usually entered by the user
        // or /* denotes a comment, useful for the translator, not used by the program
        There are 4 sections in the sidebar, differentiated by colour. Within each section are chapters. 
            Each chapter has an id that can be seen in the sidebar button. 
            The second section chapters are usualy referred to as F3, F4, etc, though they are identified as 3, 4, etc.
        Multiline translations can be made by appending a \ to the line (eg. SHARE_STRATFILE_BODY)
