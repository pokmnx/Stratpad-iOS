                Some of Amazon's values might be:
            </p>
        <ul class="list-double-spaced">
          <li>Customer Obsession: We start with the customer and work backwards.</li>
          <li>Bias for Action: We live in a time of unheralded revolution and insurmountable opportunity &#8211; provided we make every minute count.</li>
          <li>High Hiring Bar: When making a hiring decision we ask ourselves: "Will I admire this person? Will I learn from this person? Is this person a superstar?"</li>
          <li>Frugality: We spend money on things that really matter and believe that frugality breeds resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention!</li>

        <ul class="list-double-spaced">
          <li>What values do we truly and passionately hold?</li>
          <li>If the circumstances changed and penalized us for holding a value, would we keep it?</li>
          <li>If we started a new company tomorrow, in a different line of work, what values would we want to build into that new company?</li>
