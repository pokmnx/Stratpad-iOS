                These three items together form the heart of your strategy:
            </p>
        <ol class="list-double-spaced">
          <li><span class="bolder">Scope:</span> an understanding of the landscape in which you operate.</li>
          <li><span class="bolder">Advantage:</span> some combination of capabilities and resources that is unique and defendable.</li>
          <li><span class="bolder">Goal:</span> a clearly defined, medium-term target.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
                Because strategy demands specifics, you must consider trade-offs as you work through your strategy. Strategy asks that you make intentional decisions as to what you will do and, as important, what you won't do.

                Strategy tells you "You can't be all things to all people" and "Not everyone's your customer".
            </p>
        <p>
                The discipline to make difficult trade-offs along with scope, advantage and goal are at the heart of strategy:  they help you create <span class="bolder">a unique set of offerings targeted at a specific group of customers who are willing to pay your price.</span>
