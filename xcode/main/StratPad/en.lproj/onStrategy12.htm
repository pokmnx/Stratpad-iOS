                The <span class="bolder">scope</span> of your strategy is the set of boundaries within which you operate and outside of which <span class="underlined">you will not go</span>.
            </p>
        <p>
                Scope is often evaluated along multiple dimensions. The four most common are:
            </p>
        <ul>
          <li>geography</li>
          <li>target customers</li>
          <li>control, and</li>
          <li>offerings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
                These four are now introduced along with examples from Edward Jones, a financial advisory firm.
