                Your company gains an <span class="bolder">advantage</span> over its competitors when it creates a unique offering or ability that is difficult to copy and that your customers will pay for.
            </p>
        <p>
                This <span class="bolder">sustainable competitive advantage</span> is the essence of strategy and of your long-term success because:
            </p>
        <ul class="list-double-spaced">
          <li>it helps your employees understand how they can contribute to your success;</li>
          <li>it sets you apart &#8211; it is the edge that your competitors don't have; and</li>
          <li>it helps your customers more readily choose you from among your competitors.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="column column-right">
        <p>
                The last two points, in particular, significantly contribute to improving your company's financial position.  Your advantage should allow you to raise (or at least maintain) your prices, or reduce your cost of goods sold (COGS), or both. These lead to increased gross margins with a correspondingly greater ability to invest in operations.
            </p>

                Remember that an advantage can be as simple as a single element such as a restaurant's location on a high-traffic corner. More commonly, an advantage is created from a combination of abilities and resources. For example, Apple's advantage comes from a combination of elegant design, unique content (iTunes and AppStore), and product integration.
