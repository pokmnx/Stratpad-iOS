                Advantage stems from two fundamental attributes: customer value and your ability to create it (your capabilities).
            </p>
        <p><span class="bolder">Customer Value</span><br />
                Creating customer value comes from a deep understanding of your customers' needs and what contributes to their success.
            </p>
        <p>Your customers want an offering that is:</p>
        <ul class="list-double-spaced">
          <li><span class="bolder">meaningful</span>. The offering has to make a significant difference to their lives.</li>
          <li><span class="bolder">sustainable</span>. They need to trust that the offering can be consistently delivered.</li>
          <li><span class="bolder">distinctive</span>. The offering is clearly different, in a substantive way, from the available alternatives.</li>
        </ul>

                Ask yourself:
            </p>
        <ul class="list-double-spaced">
          <li>What are the benefits of using our products/services?</li>
          <li>Why should customers purchase our offering instead of an alternative?</li>
          <li>Why are we the best option?</li>
          <li>What do we want our customers to think, feel and experience?</li>
          <li>What do we want our customers to say about us to others?</li>
          <li>How can we prove that we will deliver the outcomes we say we can?</li>
          <li>How can we get customers to think, "I believe you. I trust you."</li>
