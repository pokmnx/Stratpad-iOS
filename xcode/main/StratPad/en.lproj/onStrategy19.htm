                As mentioned, your advantage is only an advantage if:
            </p>
        <ul class="list-double-spaced">
          <li>your customers are willing to pay for it, and/or</li>
          <li>it gives you a distinct advantage over your competitors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
                Your sustainable competitive advantage, therefore, grows out of:
            </p>
        <ol class="list-double-spaced list-lower-alpha">
          <li>your understanding of your customer's needs and wants,</li>
          <li>the combination of activities and resources you assemble to meet those needs, and</li>
          <li>how well they&#8217;re managed.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="column column-right">
        <p>
                This combination of customer-aligned activities and resources creates an "impenetrable thicket" that is difficult for a competitor to emulate.
            </p>
        <p>
                This is your advantage.
