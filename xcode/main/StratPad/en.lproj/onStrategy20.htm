                There's no better way to unite your staff, align your activities and create focus among your team than by communicating a <span class="bolder">single, over-arching, non-financial, medium-term goal.</span>
            </p>
        <p>
                Several things to note:
            </p>
        <ul class="list-double-spaced">
          <li>the word "goal" is singular. In order to get your team on the same page, it's important to select a single goal that everybody understands.</li>
          <li>the goal should be achievable in the "medium-term". This means different things to different companies. A start-up might select a timeframe of six months. More mature companies will select a timeframe between 2 and 5 years.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="column column-right">
        <ul>
          <li>the goal should be non-financial. While profit and shareholder return are obvious contenders for goals, they do a poor job of communicating to staff where the organization is going. We'll look at financial metrics in the next section.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
                In the meantime, here are three good examples of non-financial goals:
            </p>
        <ul class="list-double-spaced">
          <li>Edward Jones will grow to 17,000 advisors by 2012.</li>
          <li>University of Leeds will place in the top 50 universities in the world by 2015.</li>
          <li>Starbucks will have 2,000 stores by 2000.</li>
        </ul>
