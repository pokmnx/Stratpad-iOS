                You'll want to track the progress of each objective. For each objective, identify one key <span class="bolder">metric</span>, a <span class="bolder">target value</span> and a <span class="bolder">target date</span>.
            </p>
        <p>
                This is easier for some objectives. For example, "Increased gross margins" would look like this:
            </p>
        <ul>
          <li>metric: gross margin %</li>
          <li>target value: 27%</li>
          <li>target date: Dec 31, 2012</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="column column-right">
        <p>
                Metrics for other objectives such as "higher quality" may be trickier to select. You might choose an internal metric such as "error rate". Or you could choose an external metric such as "customer perception of quality".
            </p>
        <p>
                Some objectives are quite difficult to determine such as "fully trained staff". The value in the exercise is in thinking it through and coming up with something that you find meaningful. One example might be "the percentage of staff that have taken all the training". The target value would be 100% by an appropriate target date.
