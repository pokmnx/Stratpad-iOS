        <p><span class="bolder">Activity</span><br />
            Next, you will want to specify what tasks or <span class="bolder">activities</span> are required to accomplish each objective along with a <span class="bolder">budget</span> for each action.
            </p>
        <p>
                This step ties the strategy, themes and objectives directly to operations. For example, in order to fully understand the objective "revised processes" the activities needed to accomplish it should be identified, such as:
            </p>
        <ul>
          <li>retain external process advisor</li>
          <li>review and map current processes</li>
          <li>evaluate alternative processes</li>
          <li>select and document new processes</li>
          <li>develop transition and training plans</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="column column-right">
        <p>
                Identifying costs related to these activities is the final planning step.
            </p>
        <p>
                By providing budget information, staff are assured that senior management understands the full impact of their strategy; by soliciting feedback and then providing appropriate budgets, senior management gains confidence that the entire team supports the strategy.
