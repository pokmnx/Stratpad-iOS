        <p>This page expands on the four points:</p>
        <p><span class="bolder">Leadership is at the heart of strategy and execution.</span><br />
					Strategy development requires unflinching assessment, frank dialogue and clear choice-making. It also requires courage to communicate clearly and act on one's convictions. Courageous leadership results in thoughtful and well-understood direction-setting.
				</p>
        <p><span class="bolder">Strategy and execution are inextricably linked.</span><br />
					This seems obvious. Too often, however, strategic direction is decided by one group with execution left to another. This dramatically decreases the likelihood of success.
				</p>
        <p>
					Be sure to fully consider the operational, financial and human elements required to bring your strategy to life.
				</p>

      <div class="column column-right">
        <p><span class="bolder">Strategy is iterative; it must always be reviewed and adjusted regularly.</span><br />
					Strategy isn't a weekend retreat. Strategy is a way of thinking and acting that must permeate your company. Even though strategy takes a longer-term view, it needs to adjust as the landscape changes.
				</p>
        <p>
					Monitor the progress of your strategy frequently and revisit your strategy regularly.
				</p>
        <p><span class="bolder">Your customers' experience is a direct result of your leadership, your strategy, and your ability to execute.</span><br />
					When your leadership is clear, when your strategy is crisp and when your staff are aligned, your customers feel it and they respond by buying your offerings.
				</p>
        <p>Be clear; be crisp; be aligned.</p>
