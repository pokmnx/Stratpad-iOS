                "Brand" is an over-used word. Simply put, we believe that brand is the sum of all the experiences that your customer has with, and of, your firm.
            </p>
        <p>
                Brand rests solely in the eyes of the customers. You can influence it but you cannot control it.
            </p>
        <p>
                A customer's experience WITH your firm includes:
            </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the voice of the person answering your phone;</li>
          <li>your responsiveness;</li>
          <li>your return policy;</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="column column-right">
        <ul>
          <li>the cleanliness of your bathroom;</li>
          <li>your website;</li>
          <li>your pricing;</li>
          <li>the design of your product;</li>
          <li>the quality of your product;</li>
          <li>your product's packaging;</li>
          <li>your marketing;</li>
          <li>and everything else.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
                A customer's experience OF your firm includes reviews and word of mouth.
            </p>
        <p>
                One of the best things you can do for your brand is to practice thinking like your customers.
            </p>

            Never forget this: Brand is equal to the sum of your customers' exeriences and perceptions.
