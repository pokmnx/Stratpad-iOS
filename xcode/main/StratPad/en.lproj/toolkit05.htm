                A "SWOT" analysis fully considers the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats faced by your company.
            </p>
        <p>
                Strategy then determines whether they are important enough to consider (i.e. do we care?) and, if so, how you will respond.
            </p>
        <p>
                Typically, strengths and weaknesses are internal aspects of your company. Ask yourself, "What do we do well or poorly?"
            </p>

                Opportunities and threats usually arise externally from customers, competitors and regulators.

                The next page shows a basic SWOT table.  Use it to answer these questions:
            </p>
        <ol>
          <li>What are the items that will affect us in the medium-term?</li>
          <li>How important are they to us?</li>
          <li>Should we respond to them?  If so, how?  When?</li>
        </ol>
