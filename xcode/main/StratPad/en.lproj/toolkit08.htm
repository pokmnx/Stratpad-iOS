                The Sweet Spot diagram has 8 regions:
            </p>
        <p>
                Regions 1 &amp; 2: This is the Sweet Spot. Your target customer is willing to pay for offerings in this region.
            </p>
        <p>
                Region 1 is your Super Sweet Spot: your customer <span class="bolder">perceives</span> your offering as unique and is willing to pay for it. Price pressure is reduced.
            </p>
        <p>
                Region 2 is affected by competitive offerings: your price (and gross profit) may be squeezed.
            </p>
        <p>
                Strategically, you&#8217;ll likely want to defend these areas and even expand them.

        <p>
                In Region 3, your customer has identified a need but has been unable to find a suitable supplier.
            </p>
        <p>
                Region 4 identifies products or services that your target customer is not willing to pay for.
