                Region 5 is your competitor&#8217;s "super sweet spot". They are free to sell their offerings unopposed.
            </p>
        <p>
                In Region 6, you and your competitors have offerings that your target customers are not willing to pay for.
            </p>
        <p>
                Region 7 identifies an area where neither you nor your competitors have offerings and where your target customers haven't identified a need. This could be the future: are your customers moving in that direction? Could you develop an offering that anticipates their needs? Doing so successfully could expand your Super Sweet Spot.

                Finally, Region 8 identifies competitor offerings that you don't match and that your target customer is unwilling to pay for.
