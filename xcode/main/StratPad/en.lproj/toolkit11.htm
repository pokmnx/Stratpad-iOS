                The "Value Ladder" tool is a way to think about how to expand your profitability.
            </p>
        <p>
                Think of yourself as one link in a value chain. In this chain you purchase products and services from your suppliers, you transform those products and services internally, and you sell the resulting product or service to your customers.
            </p>
        <p>
                Your profit is the excess between the price you receive from your customer and the sum of all your costs.
