                Instead, shift focus to increase gross profit and see what happens.
            </p>
        <p>
                First, the obvious options change to "grow revenues" and "decrease cost of goods sold".  These don't conflict.
            </p>
        <p>
                Second, increased gross profit provides more cash to invest in expenses.  Treating expenses as investments substantially changes perspective: expenses are no longer something to be minimized but investments that must produce a return.
            </p>
        <p>
                Finally, the shift away from expense-cutting allows other options to surface and be considered.

                To illustrate, let's look at two identical companies, each of which has a large customer call center. Each company wants to increase its net income within 12 months.
            </p>
        <p><span class="bolder">Company A decides to cut its call center expense.</span> They expect these savings will fall straight to the bottom line.
            </p>
        <p><span class="bolder">Company B decides to <span class="underlined">increase</span> their call center expense.</span>  They believe that investing in their customer support center will increase revenues significantly more than their call center investment.
            </p>
        <p>
                Let's see what happens...
