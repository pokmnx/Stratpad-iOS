                Too often, companies create strategy that is complicated, cumbersome and fails to communicate. And if it's tough to communicate, it's tough to align the staff around it.
            </p>
        <p>
                A better idea is to summarize your strategy into one or two lines.
            </p>
        <p>
                Here's a brief strategy definition followed by a guide to creating a short strategy statement.
            </p>
        <p>
                Strategy is a <span class="bolder">beacon</span> that specifies a <span class="bolder">goal,</span> a <span class="bolder">time frame</span> for achieving that goal, the <span class="bolder">context</span> in which the goal will be reached, and the company's <span class="bolder">unique approach</span> that guarantees its success.
            </p>

        <p>
                Read that again and then let&#700;s look at it more closely.
            </p>
        <p>
                Understanding the five key elements of the strategy definition makes it easier to create your own strategy. Here they are:
            </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
                    The word <span class="bolder">goal</span> is singular.<br /><br />
                    Strategy focuses the entire organization around a single sharp point. Do one thing and do it exceedingly well. Sharply defined strategy pierces like a well-honed spear; a strategy with multiple goals pierces like a marshmallow.
                </li>
        </ol>
