                    A <span class="bolder">time frame</span> is vital.<br /><br />
                    It provides impetus and motivation. Combined with a clearly stated goal, the time frame becomes the first of several metrics that are necessary to successfully implement your strategy. Choose a date that's two to five years away.

                    The <span class="bolder">context</span> describes the specific competitive arena in which the company will operate.<br /><br />
                    Be crystal clear on this. Don't just say "By 2012 we&#700;ll grow to a 10 restaurant chain." It's too broad and provides no real guidance. Instead, say "By 2012 we'll grow to a chain of 10 family-oriented, sit-down, full-service, Italian restaurants in southern Oregon."

                    The most important part of strategy is defining your <span class="bolder">unique approach.</span><br /><br />
                    What makes you different from your competitors? Why would somebody choose to eat in your Italian restaurant rather than the one next door? Is it the food? The location? The physical design? The live Italian music? It must be unique and it must be something that your competitors can't easily replicate.
