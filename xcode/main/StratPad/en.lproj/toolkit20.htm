                    Once a strategy has been created it needs to be simply stated and widely communicated throughout your company in order to achieve its full potential. One of the best ways of doing this is to reduce your strategy to a single sentence.
                </li>
        </ol>

            </p>
        <p>
                Perfect. One sentence that can be spoken in less than 15 seconds.
