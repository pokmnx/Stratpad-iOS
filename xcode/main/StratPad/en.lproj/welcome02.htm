            StratPad helps you learn about strategy, create your own strategy, and then execute your strategy. Here's how:

        <p><span class="bolder">Learn</span><br />
                The first four chapters teach you basic strategy concepts and how to use StratPad. In the Navigator (on the left of the screen) the Learn chapters start with lower-case roman numerals (i, ii, iii and iv).
            </p>
        <p><span class="bolder">Create</span><br />
                Use the next chapters (numbered from 1 to 7) to think about and create the strategic aspects of your company.
